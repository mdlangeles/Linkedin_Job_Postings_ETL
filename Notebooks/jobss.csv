<div>At Chainlink Labs, our engineering team pushes the scale and capabilities of decentralized applications across the industry.

<div></div>
<div>The infrastructure org enables Chainlink development and maintains services that support the health of the most widely-adopted oracle network in the world. The Node Operations team are the ‘Gold Standard’ when it comes to running Chainlink, streamlining the experience for any would-be node operator. They manage all of the internally-deployed nodes—like testnet OCR, VRF, Automation and blockchain nodes &#8212; both internal and external. As a Site Reliability Engineer, you will help us solve some of the unique challenges of blockchain oracle architecture and be primarily responsible for the Chainlink ecosystem&#8217;s off-chain part.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We are distributed across time zones and continents, and we embrace remote work. In the Infrastructure team, we follow the infrastructure-as-code approach and practice GitOps. Our on-call rotation uses the follow-the-sun pattern: you will be on call some of the time, but there should not be any overnight shifts.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We all have different backgrounds and are determined to help you succeed no matter where you are or who you are. If you think you would do a great job at Chainlink, we are looking forward to speaking with you, even if you don&#8217;t match 100% of the job requirements: those describe people we&#8217;ve usually had a great time working with, but they&#8217;re not a tick-box exercise.</div>

<h2><strong>What We Do</strong></h2>
<p>Forging futures in tech is our vision. Udacity is where lifelong learners come to learn the skills they need, to land the jobs they want, and to build the lives they deserve.</p>
<h2><strong>Don’t stop there!  Please keep reading&#8230;</strong></h2>
<p>You’ve probably heard the following statistic: Most male applicants only meet 60% of the qualifications, while women and other marginalized candidates only apply if they meet 100% of the qualifications. If <strong>you</strong> think you have what it takes but don’t meet every single point in the job description, please apply!</p>
<p>We believe that historically, many processes disproportionately hurt the most marginalized communities in society- including people of color, working-class backgrounds, women and LGBTQ people. Centering these communities at our core is pivotal for any successful organization and a value we uphold steadfastly.  Therefore, Udacity strongly encourages applications from all communities and backgrounds.</p>
